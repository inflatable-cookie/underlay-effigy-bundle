# Underlay Effigy Bundle

Git-hosted bundle for the Underlay-style Rust + Bun workspace stack.

## Usage

In your repo's `effigy.toml`:

```toml
[bundle]
base = { type = "git", url = "git@github.com:inflatable-cookie/underlay-effigy-bundle.git" }
host = "acme.test"
workspace_subdir = "acme"
databases = ["acme", "acme_test"]
```

When `project_name` is omitted, the bundle derives one from
`<workspace_subdir>-underlay`, for example `acme-underlay`.

## Inputs

See `bundle.toml` for the full input schema.

Key required inputs:
- `host` — Primary local hostname
- `workspace_subdir` — Repo path under `/workspace-root`
- `databases` — Postgres databases to create

Optional inputs:
- `browser_runtime` — Workspace image browser layer (`"none"` by default,
  `"chromium"` for the opt-in Chromium system libraries). Requires
  Effigy `>= 0.13.1`; older releases reject this bundle revision on the
  `minimum_effigy_version` floor instead of silently ignoring the setting.

## Browser runtime (`browser_runtime`)

The bundle forwards `browser_runtime` to the `workspace-rust-bun` catalog
service as its `BROWSER_RUNTIME` image build arg:

```toml
[bundle]
# ... required inputs ...
browser_runtime = "chromium"
```

- `none` (default) leaves the ordinary Rust/Bun image unchanged.
- `chromium` installs Debian Bookworm Chromium runtime libraries and a
  basic font set as root at image build. Unknown values fail the image
  build.
- Changing the value requires rebuilding the workspace image (for example
  `effigy container reset` followed by `effigy container up`) before the new
  layer takes effect.
- The image ships no browser binary, Playwright, or Node. The consuming
  repo owns its matching browser installation into the `dev` user cache
  (for example `bunx playwright install --only-shell chromium` or the
  Playwright revision its lockfile pins), after the rebuilt image is up.

## Bundle-owned secrets

The bundle declares the shared Underlay runtime secret contract, including:

- `auth_jwt_private_key`
- `auth_jwt_public_key`
- `auth_oauth_secret_key`
- `encryption_key`
- `aws_access_key_id`
- `aws_secret_access_key`
- `smtp_password`
- `auth_google_client_secret`

App-specific secrets should stay in the consuming repo.

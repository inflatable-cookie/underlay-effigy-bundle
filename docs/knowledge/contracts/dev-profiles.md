# Development profiles and ownership

## Direction

The intended consumer development default is hybrid: isolated service
containers for Postgres, MinIO, Mailpit and DbGate, with Rust and Bun processes
on the host. `dev:container` retains the Linux whole-stack path. `dev:test`
provides a short-lived, worktree-isolated host and service environment without
automatically running full QA.

These are intended profiles, not a claim that the current bundle implements
them. Existing defaults remain container-based. New profile additions must be
opt-in and backward-compatible; switching a consumer's `dev` default requires
an explicit migration after qualification. Container-only use remains valid.

## Ownership

The bundle owns Rust and Vite adapters, service declarations, profile-specific
connection URLs, browser origins, HMR configuration and selector wiring.
Effigy owns language-agnostic execution, environment delivery, readiness and
gateway ownership primitives. Oxide separately owns Rust build and cache
management. The bundle must not introduce another supervisor, allocator or
cache manager to cover a missing Effigy primitive.

Host processes connect to services through reachable loopback endpoints.
Browser-facing HTTPS URLs are distinct from internal bind addresses. Qualified
profiles must prove SvelteKit origins and Vite HMR WebSocket connectivity
through the gateway. Host and Linux dependencies and build artifacts are not
interchangeable.

## Runtime identity and ports

An instance identity covers its checkout, runtime generation and profile.
Frontend, admin, API and additional Rust listeners have distinct owned
addresses. Prefer OS port zero with discovery of the actual listener where the
adapter supports it. Otherwise require exclusive allocation claims, strict
binding and bounded collision retry. A free-port probe is not a reservation.

Publish a route only after proving readiness of its owned listener. Keep the
actual address current across restart and reject foreign hostname takeover.
Cleanup affects only recorded instance resources. Neither age nor a missing
PID establishes that an allocation can be released; uncertain ownership must
remain explicit.

## Qualification boundary

Underlay Reference is the designated pilot for profile qualification and later
opt-in implementation and adoption proof. Use disposable owned checkouts,
worktrees and instances of `underlay-reference`; preserve its operator checkout
and live stack. Acowtancy is excluded from testing, mutation and rollout until
the solution is qualified and explicit later adoption is arranged.

Use those private disposable consumer fixtures and isolated owned resources. Cover
two worktrees and a main-checkout identity starting simultaneously, occupied
ports, child restart, partial launch failure, interrupted cleanup and uncertain
ownership. Isolated teardown must preserve foreign processes and routes.
Assemble the branch from a private consumer and prove unchanged default inputs
and `sources.siblings = false`, following [release.md](release.md).

Existing live infrastructure is read-only. Profile qualification does not
authorize changes to Acow deployment, volumes, data or config; live gateway,
resolver or settings; the global executable; Queue/Nucleus scheduling; frozen
010; providers, workflows, releases or tags. Existing allocation-pruning and
consumer host-wiring findings remain separate evidence, not claimed repairs.

If supported interfaces cannot establish these properties, report the
smallest generic Effigy capability gap with an executable reproduction. A
blocked capability must not become an invented CLI or private protocol.
